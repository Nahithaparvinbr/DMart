Visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, tables, and maps were used to show category-wise sales, customer age distribution, time spent on the website, and location analysis.Filters (slicers) such as Category, Gender, and Payment Method were added to make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly. This project helps in understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance for better business decision-making.
